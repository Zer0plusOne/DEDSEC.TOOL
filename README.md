Free use tool and open source made with the objective of achieving what I'd like to describe as a Swiss Army Knife to have all diferent functions in a easy acces tool by entering diferent inputs without the needing of having all the tools separately.

I will be adding new functions and features to make the tool more and more complete, adding the posibility to misc some functions with the objective of developing new functions.

Add to this, that the tool is inspired in the first game of "Watch Dogs" developed by Ubisoft, so the aesthetics of the tool will be related to this.

# ToDo List

This is a project actually under developement, so i leave a quick list of all the things i want to implement. With a simple color status about how the developement is going
